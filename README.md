Users may also save articles to their favorite and/or read later lists. They may also follow liked news channels.
Browsing has been designed in such a way to allow those interested to find articles in the shortest time possible via 
the search route or filters both ascending and descending ( by publish date, category, tag, publisher, title ).
Moreover as they interact with posts, suggested articles will pop up by collaborative filtering ( favorited by similar users ),
or by content filtering ( from favorite article's category or tag ).
